Welcome to the open-source Voice-Assisted Desktop Assistant project! Contributions are always appreciated, and it's a breeze to get involved. Here's how you can contribute:

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Project:** Click the "Fork" button at the top-right to create your copy of the project.

2. **Make Changes:** Work on what interests you - add new features, fix bugs, or improve documentation on a **_separate branch_**. It's your playground!

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
    ```

3. **Commit Changes:** Use clear and simple commit messages. For example:

    - "Added a weather command"
    - "Fixed voice recognition bug"

        ```bash
        git commit -m "<mandatory commit message here>" -m "<optional commit description here>"
        ```

4. **Push to Your Fork:** Send your changes back to your forked repository.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```

5. **Create a Pull Request (PR):** Open a PR to the main project repository. Describe your changes briefly and why they're awesome. MAKE SURE TO USE THE PREDEFINED PULL REQUEST TEMPLATE.

6. Note that the PR will have to successfully pass all the workflows setup via GitHub action. A successfully checked PR
   will be then reviewed and then merged. Any changes suggested must be met before PR can be merged.

## Guidelines

- Have fun! This is an open-source project, and we're all here to learn and enjoy coding together.
- Keep it simple. Make sure your code is easy for others (and your future self) to understand.
- Make sure to use comments wherever needed and update the `README.md` file if necessary.
- Test your changes. Ensure things work as expected.
- Share your thoughts. If you have ideas or questions, open an issue to discuss them.

That's it! Thanks for being part of this project. Every contribution, big or small, makes a difference.
