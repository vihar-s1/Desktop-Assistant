## 🚀 Introduction

- A Python-based desktop assistant configured to automate some of the day-to-day tasks and help save time.
- Voice assistance is used to provide a hands-free interface to the user as the assistant can run in the background while performing day-to-day tasks.
- `Extras.py` and `Support.py` files are for having additional globally required variables, and query functions handling individual queries respectively.
- The `VoiceInterface.py` file contains the **_VoiceInterface_** class which handles the abstraction of user voice recognition and assistant speech.
- The `Assistant.py` file contains the main code integrating everything together to run the assistant properly.

## ✨ Features

- Google and Wikipedia searches 🌐
- Run applications or websites from a predefined map/list 🚀
- Tell time of the day in _hour **:** minute **:** second_ format ⏰
