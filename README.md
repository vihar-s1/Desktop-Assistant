## üöÄ Introduction

- The project is a simple Python-based desktop assistant that can perform basic tasks like searching on Google, opening applications, telling the time, and more.
- The assistant is still in the development phase, and more features will be added in the future.
- The assistant is built using Python and does not use any Machine Learning (ML) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.
- The assistant is built using the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech conversion and the `speech_recognition` library for speech recognition.
- The project is open-source and contributions and/or feature requests are always welcome.

## ‚ú® Features

- Google and Wikipedia searches üåê
- Open applications and websites üöÄ
- Tell time of the day in _hour **:** minute **:** second_ format ‚è∞
- Scroll the screen up and down, left and right. üìú

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below.

- The project is built using Python, so make sure you have Python installed on your system.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Download and extract the zip file or clone the repository using the following command.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vihar-s1/Desktop-Assistant
    ```

2. In the project root directory run `setupProject.sh` script to create a virtual environment, and setup the project.

    ```bash
    bash setupProject.sh
    ```

3. Once setup is complete, simply run the `assistant.py` file to start using the Assistant.

    ```bash
    python3 assistant.py
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è macOS Specific Fixes

If you encounter the following error on macOS:

#### @objc.python_method annotation error

> File ".../.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pyttsx3/drivers/nsss.py", line 27, in NSSpeechDriver  
>    @objc.python_method  
>    ^^^^  
> NameError: name 'objc' is not defined. Did you mean: 'object'?  

Then open the `nsss.py` library file and import `objc` at the top of the file.

```python
import objc
```

You may need to install `PyObjC` using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install pyobjc
```

#### NSSpeechDriver super() error

If you encounter the following error:

>   File "/Users/viharshah/Desktop/IdeaProjects/Desktop-Assistant/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pyttsx3/drivers/nsss.py", line 30, in initWithProxy  
> self = super(NSSpeechDriver, self).init()  
> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
> AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 'init'  
> sys:1: UninitializedDeallocWarning: leaking an uninitialized object of type NSSpeechDriver

Then replace the `super(NSSpeechDriver, self).init()` line with the following:

```python3
objc.super(NSSpeechDriver, self).init()
```
