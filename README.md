## üöÄ Introduction

- A Python-based desktop assistant configured to automate some of the day-to-day tasks and help save time.
- Voice assistance is used to provide a hands-free interface to the user as the assistant can run in the background while performing day-to-day tasks.
- `external_paths.py` and `support.py` files are for having additional globally required variables, and query functions
  handling individual queries respectively.
- The `voice_interface.py` file contains the **_VoiceInterface_** class which handles the abstraction of user voice
  recognition and assistant speech.
- The `assistant.py` file contains the main code integrating everything together to run the assistant properly.

## ‚ú® Features

- Google and Wikipedia searches üåê
- Run applications or websites from a predefined map/list üöÄ
- Tell time of the day in _hour **:** minute **:** second_ format ‚è∞

## üöÄ Getting Started

- Fork or download the project.
- Install the Python dependencies mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file using pip or pip3.
- Run the main Python file named `assistant.py` in the project root folder to run the assistant.

### üìã Prerequisites

- The project is coded using `Python 3.11.0`, so it would be best to install an equivalent or later version.
- The modules required are listed in the requirements.txt file which can be installed as discussed below.

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Download and extract the zip file or clone the repository using the following command.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vihar-s1/Desktop-Assistant
    ```

2. In the project root directory run following script to create a virtual environment, and setup the project.

    ```bash
    bash setupProject.sh
    ```

3. Once setup is complete, simply run the `assistant.py` file to start using the Assistant.

    ```bash
    python assistant.py
    ```

### üõ†Ô∏è macOS Specific Fixes

If you encounter the following error on MacOS:

#### @objc.python_method annotation error

> File ".../.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pyttsx3/drivers/nsss.py", line 27, in NSSpeechDriver  
>    @objc.python_method  
>    ^^^^  
> NameError: name 'objc' is not defined. Did you mean: 'object'?  

Then open the `nsss.py` library file and import `objc` at the top of the file.

```python
import objc
```

You may need to install `PyObjC` using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install pyobjc
```

#### NSSpeechDriver super() error

If you encounter the following error:

>   File "/Users/viharshah/Desktop/IdeaProjects/Desktop-Assistant/.venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pyttsx3/drivers/nsss.py", line 30, in initWithProxy  
> self = super(NSSpeechDriver, self).init()  
> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  
> AttributeError: 'super' object has no attribute 'init'  
> sys:1: UninitializedDeallocWarning: leaking an uninitialized object of type NSSpeechDriver

Then replace the `super(NSSpeechDriver, self).init()` line with the following:

```python3
objc.super(NSSpeechDriver, self).init()
```
